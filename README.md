About Me
==========================

Good day!

I'm SierraVanguard, or Sierra for short. Took me a while to come up with an alias to suit me, that's what I came up with.

Currently, am a computer science undergrad at some university in some backwater european country, getting better and better at coding. My strong suit is Python, but I don't mind getting my hands dirty with some C, C# or Lua.

For miscellaneous inquiries - sivanyuk37@gmail.com -

If you ever feel like chatting to me in person, the best bet would be my [Discord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
